Hi, <br />
I am Kumar Ankit, and I am currently pursuing my PhD in the field of Cyber Physical Systems at IISc, Bangalore under the Prime Minister's Research Fellowship (PMRF). Prior to this, I completed my bachelors in Mining Engineering from IIT Kharagpur in 2018. Besides my major as an undergraduate, my work revolved around the autonomous applications of drones in agriculture, industrial robotics and swarm of ground vehicles.

My current research interests are in the fields of guidance, navigation and autonomous control of multi-agent systems. Being a PMRF scholar, my project is inclined towards co-ordinated use of drones and ground vehicles for defense and agricultural purposes, aligned to our country's national priorities. Apart from my academics, I like to trek in the mountains and go on long road trips.
